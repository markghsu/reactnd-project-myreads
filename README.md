# React MyReads Project

This project was created as part of the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019). It displays a bookshelf and allows users to access a pre-built API to find and mark books as "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read".

## Running the application

`npm install` will install necessary components
`npm start` will begin serving the app on localhost:3000
